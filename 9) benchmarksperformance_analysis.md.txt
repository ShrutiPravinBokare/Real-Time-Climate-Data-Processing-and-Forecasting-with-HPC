# Performance Analysis

## Objective
Measure the performance improvements using OpenMP for parallel processing in `data_processor.cpp`.

## Results
- **Without OpenMP**: Processing time for dataset: 2.5 seconds.
- **With OpenMP**: Processing time for dataset: 0.9 seconds.

The parallelized version improves processing time by approximately 64%.
