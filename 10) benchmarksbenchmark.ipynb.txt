This Jupyter notebook would contain graphs of processing times under different configurations and a comparison of serial vs. parallel processing. Here's an example of code content:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample benchmark data
labels = ['Serial', 'Parallel']
times = [2.5, 0.9]

plt.bar(labels, times, color=['red', 'blue'])
plt.ylabel('Processing Time (seconds)')
plt.title('Performance Comparison')
plt.show()
