# Real-Time Climate Data Processing and Forecasting

## Overview
This project leverages high-performance computing (HPC) to process climate data and forecast trends. The application fetches climate data in real-time, applies parallel processing to improve performance, and uses forecasting models to predict trends.

## Setup and Installation

1) Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-climate-forecasting.git
   cd real-time-climate-forecasting

2) Configure API keys in config/config.json.

3) Compile and run the project (if C++) or execute the Python script.


Usage -
Run the main executable to start fetching, processing, and forecasting climate data.
